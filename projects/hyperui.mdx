HyperUI is one of the most popular Tailwind CSS components libraries on GitHub
with around 2.8k stars as of writing this. It's free, is open-source and
features over 250 components across marketing, eCommerce and application UI.

It's built with Next JS, Typescript and Tailwind CSS with components being HTML.
I opted for Typescript as it's an extra layer to prevent mistakes, this is vital
with the project being open-source.

As for the decision to create components in HTML it just makes sense. Even if
you are using JSX, Blade, Liquid... It's all HTML.

As well as components, HyperUI features a blog post that talks about the
following:

- Tips and tricks for Tailwind CSS
- Project updates and announcements
- Related project announcements
