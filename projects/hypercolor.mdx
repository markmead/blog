Hypercolor is a collection of pre-made gradients created with Tailwind CSS. It has been extended to provide `radial` and `conic` gradients through changes to the Tailwind CSS config.

As well as pre-made gradients there are gradient generators for the following:

- Standard gradients
- Mesh gradients
- Grainy gradients

It also features flags created with Tailwind CSS and the ability to favourite gradients to be viewed later.

The website is built with Nuxt JS and Tailwind CSS.
