description: How many rare items will I get? Spoiler. A lot.

In the Borderlands 2 DLC "Commander Lilith & the Fight for Sanctuary" there's a
boss called Uranus which has an extremely high drop rate of legendaries,
pearlescents and effervescent items.

Due to this drop rate, I thought I'd farm the boss a bunch and record what I
find.

And there you have it.

Was there a pattern? Not that I can see, but there were a few odd:

- No pearlescents from run 18 to 39
- Low drop rates from run 20 to 30
- High Legendary Berserker drop rate from run 51 to 60
- Guranteed legendary, pearlescents or effervescent item from run 37 to 60

Out of all of those drops I kept two items:

- The Electric Chair (Run 10)
- Double Penetrating Unkempt Harold (Run 45)

Worth it ðŸ¥²
