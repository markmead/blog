_This is an old post that I have updated, I no longer use Ruby on Rails._

Hotwire is awesome, it brings an improved user and developer experience to Ruby
on Rails applications. There is one downside, it replaced Turbolinks... A sad
day to be sure.

However, don't be too sad because although Turbolinks is gone, Turbo is here.

You can find out more on the [Hotwire website](https://hotwire.dev/).

## Turbolinks vs Turbo

|           | Works with Links | Works with Forms |
| --------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Turbo     | Yes              | Yes              |
| Turblinks | Yes              | No               |

That's it. Turbo works with forms and links. Turbolinks works with links.

## Breaking Alpine JS

In Alpine JS you have the `x-show` directive which hides HTML elements until the
expression passed is `true`. However, when using Alpine JS with Turbo it breaks
this functionality in Alpine JS and causes HTML elements to always show.

Thankfully, [SimoTo](https://github.com/SimoTo) has created
[Alpine Turbo Drive Adapter](https://github.com/SimoTod/alpine-turbo-drive-adapter)
a small JavaScript package that fixes the issue and makes Turbo and Alpine JS
work together.
