HyperJS is an open-source collection of Alpine JS components. I built this
project based on the annoyance of having to write duplicate Alpine JS logic for
different projects.

I've built examples with Tailwind CSS but have limited the UI so that they are
presentable within the context of HyperJS, but are not full of Tailwind CSS
bloat, this makes them easy to drop into any project.

I also use HyperJS as a platform to showcase off plugins that I and others have
built for Alpine JS.

The website is built with Next JS and Tailwind CSS.
