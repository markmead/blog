I've created (in my opinion) a lot of Alpine JS plugins. The thought process behind these plugins come from:

- Random ideas
- Nice to haves
- Problem solving

Here are the plugins.

_Please note, this might not be the full list._

### [Alpine JS Component](https://github.com/markmead/alpinejs-component)

Create reusable components with HTML and Alpine JS reactivity.

### [Alpine JS Form Validation](https://github.com/markmead/alpinejs-form-validation)

Handle live form validation with Alpine JS and no custom JavaScript or dependencies.

### [Alpine JS Tash](https://github.com/markmead/alpinejs-tash)

This allows you to render Alpine JS data without the need of `x-text`.

### [Alpine JS Masonry](https://github.com/markmead/alpinejs-masonry)

Create a masonry grid using the CSS grid rules/values with the addition of `x-masonry` on the element. It features configure options.

### [Alpine JS Emit](https://github.com/markmead/alpinejs-emit)

Ever wanted to change another elements `x-data` values when a change occurs? Well now you can with `$emit`.

### [Alpine JS Manage](https://github.com/markmead/alpinejs-manage)

Much like `$emit` but focuses on a single element with a more "Alpine-y" syntax.

### [Alpine JS Head](https://github.com/markmead/alpinejs-head)

Change values in the `<head>` with Alpine JS using the directive syntax.

Convert a string such as "Hello World" into a slug "hello-world".

### [Alpine JS Overlap](https://github.com/markmead/alpinejs-overlap)

Detect if an element is overlapping another. Honestly, I don't see a use case for this, I just wanted to get the code off Codepen.

### [Alpine JS Form Data](https://github.com/markmead/alpinejs-form-data)

Grab the current values of inputs in the form. This can be done with `$formData` or `$formDataArray` if you prefer nested array syntax.

### [Alpine JS Sticky](https://github.com/markmead/alpinejs-sticky)

Detect if an element is stuck in the viewport and apply classes based on if it is or isn't.
