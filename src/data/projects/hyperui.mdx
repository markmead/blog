HyperUI is one of the most popular Tailwind CSS components libraries on GitHub
with around 4.2k stars as of writing this. It's free, is open-source and
features over 350 components across marketing, eCommerce and application UI.

It's built with Next JS, Typescript and Tailwind CSS with components being written in HTML.
I opted for Typescript as it helps explain the project without needing documentation, it's not a replacement for documentation but it should help developers pick up the project easier.

As for the decision to create components in HTML, it just makes sense. Even if
you are using JSX, Blade, Liquid... It's all HTML.

As well as components, HyperUI features a blog post that talks about Tailwind CSS development.
